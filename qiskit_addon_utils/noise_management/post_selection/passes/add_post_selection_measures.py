    """Add a post selection measurement after every terminal measurement.

    A post selection measurement is a measurement that follows a regular measurement on a given qubit. It
    consists of a narrowband X-pulse followed by a regular measurement operation. In the absence of noise,
    it is expected to return ``(b + 1) % 2``, where ``b`` is the outcome of the original measurement.

    This pass adds post selection measurements after every terminal measurement, i.e., after every measurement
    that is not followed by another operation on the same wire. The added measurements are placed after a
    barrier, and write to new classical registers that are copies of the DAG's registers, with modified
    names.

    .. note::
        When this pass encounters a control flow operation, it iterates through all of its blocks. It marks
        as "terminated" only those qubits that are terminated in every one of the blocks, and it treats as
        unterminated every other qubit.
